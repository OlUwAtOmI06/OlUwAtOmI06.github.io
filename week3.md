THIS IS A SUMMARY OF EVENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THIS WEEK AT CEALMS 2024


MONDAY 
9 - 10 : Review of github and introduction plus Use of OVERLEAF
10 - 12:30 : WRITING SESSION WITH DR ANITA PANDEY
Writing Workshop  Session 2

Everyone has a regional accent. 
It. Is not easy to decode an accents that you are not familiar with
It’s never bad to Collect comments or  feedback.
It’s okay to be nervous.

How to read a piece.
First Look at the Abstract as it summaries its importance.
Then look at the methodology: it answers why and what and it suggest based on key word
Make sure it is fresh under Ten Years
There is a research gap always
The methodology is not just how you  get your research but what steps you follow
You have to be honest

PACKING Trauma: you need to be able to coin and pack things Into a word
Credible sources are blindly reviewed by scholars and experts in that field
Make sure you Analyze do not Summarize.
Leading Question can force you to be biased
Plagiarism is unavoidable 
So Paraphrase and reiterate do not summarize

BroadStudy : Parking is a problem in American Universities
You do not. need ten thousands of research paper reading


Find A Study and Dissect the Abstract try to make  sure it’s in the last 3 to 5 years

1;30 - 5 LAB
USING JAMES WALKER LIBRARY TO FIND RESEARCH PAPER
PAPER ONE: PREDICTING UNIVERSITY CAMPUS PARKING USING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

TUESDAY:
MEETING WITH DR ANITA PANDEY

RESEARCH PAPER CONTIUATION 
Abstract:

The study focuses on predicting parking demand at each parking zone on a university campus using machine learning models, following the trip generation step of travel demand modeling.
The University of Texas at Tyler campus was used as a case study.
Parking lots were assigned to demand zones (PDZs) based on proximity to classroom buildings. Hourly arrival demand at each PDZ was measured.
Course schedule and floor space data for each building were used as input parameters to predict parking demand.
Linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed. An ANN model had an R-squared of 0.846 and was recommended.
An equation was extracted from the ANN model for course schedulers to use to modify schedules and better mitigate parking demand without needing new parking facilities.

Methodology:

UT Tyler campus was divided into 9 parking demand zones (PDZs) based on adjacent classroom buildings. Parking lots were assigned to each PDZ.
Pneumatic tube counters measured hourly arrival demand at each PDZ entrance/exit over a 1-week period.
Course schedule data for Spring 2021 and building floor space data were obtained as input parameters.
Seven input parameters were used: classroom space, total floor space, lab space, office space, walking time from PDZ, enrollment at hour t, and enrollment at hour t+1.
Five research questions were posed to evaluate linear regression vs ANN models and the impact of modifying course schedules using the model.
A stand-alone equation was extracted from the recommended ANN model (PANN) for course schedulers to use outside of MATLAB.

ABSTRACT
IoT technology has been applied to various fields, improving convenience and quality of life.
The study aims to develop a solution for the congestion, gas-wasting, and stress-inducing struggles faced by commuters while parking at a university.
The proposed system uses a single Raspberry Pi and a camera module stationed above a parking lot.
Deep learning techniques are applied to identify cars and non-car objects, enabling the detection of vacant and non-vacant parking spots.
The system delivers real-time parking-related information to commuters through an Android app.
The researchers tested the system in a simulated environment and found that it provides an average of 98% confidence in distinguishing between cars and non-cars and detecting the occupancy status of parking spaces.
