Monday

I started working on the model building using the similar code pattern as the first one with tiny twicks sice the image is slanted and the video is longer.


Tuesday

I was still working on the code as i was still stuck.
I had a meeting with my faculty mentor about my code.
I trained for Wednesday Presentation as i was very nervous.


Wednesday

We presented all or mid summer  work and i discovered that Project 9 was quite similar to ours.
Project 9 : Queryable Computer Vision Pipeline for Traffic video Analysis.
and ours Project 3: Enhancing Parking Efficiency through Predictive Modeling and Live Tracking	

**SIMILARIES** Traffic and Vehicle Analysis
  - Project 9: Focuses on analyzing traffic flow and patterns, which can be used to optimize traffic management and improve road safety.
  - Project 3: Concentrates on analyzing parking behavior and availability, aiming to improve parking efficiency and reduce the time spent searching for parking spots.

Application of Computer Vision
   - Project 9: Utilizes a computer vision pipeline to analyze traffic videos, extracting valuable data such as vehicle counts, traffic density, and possibly identifying traffic violations.
   - Project 3: Likely employs computer vision techniques to monitor parking lots, detect available parking spots, and track vehicle movements in real-time.


Thursday
Worked more on the code and followed up with the Parking office

Friday
Did our delivarbles
Had a team meeting 
Watch youtube tutorials about opencv and
