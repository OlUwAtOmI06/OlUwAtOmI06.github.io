## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: The main purpose of our project is to enhance  parking efficiency through predictive modelling  and live tracking  at Morgan state to help solve the parking issues.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:
     Uses historical data  to enhance predictive modelling, reduce parking time  and  preserve the efficiency of  parking allocations.  
     Combines the IoT sensor and camera to give more precise parking. 
 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the program. We also plan on building a parking model.
