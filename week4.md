REVIEW: Predicting University Campus Parking
Demand Using Machine Learning Models

ABSTRACT
 Past research has studied the effect of the course schedule on parking permit pricing: however, no model has been developed to directly correlate the course schedule with the parking demand.
The School Course Schedule plays an important role in parking for both faculty and students.

Research Question 1 (RQ1): Can a simple linear regression model accurately predict the hourly arrival demand at each parking zone on a campus?
 Research Question 2 (RQ2): Can a more sophisticated model, such as an artificial neural network. (ANN), be developed to better predict the hourly arrival demand at each parking zone on a campus?
Research Question 3 (RQ3): Can an artificial neural network (ANN) model be developed using only the course schedule to accurately predict the hourly arrival demand at each parking zone on a university campus?
Research Question 4 (RQ4): What is the best model developed from the first three research
questions, and what equation should be used by course schedulers?
 Research Question 5 (RQ5): What are the changes in demand at each parking zone on a university campus if a modification is made to the course schedule?
Parking permits are what is used to build parking spots and they cover only a small amount. 
According to the students surveyed in the research.
Cost of Parking Permit was the most important when determine parking factor
Walking distance to class is the second most Important.

METHODOLOGY
 RQ 3. Should be developable since it said in the methodology that student typical park in the zone closest to their classroom building to minimize walking. So, the class and building according to the schedule with the most students or where most students take their courses, the zone closest will have the most people.

RESEARCH DESIGN = it was qualitative research as the data was gotten from the parking office
PARTICIPANTS = Faculty and Students 
DATA COLLECTION = they used existing data sets
DATA ANALYSIS =
RQ1 Answer = A multiple linear regression of seven was used to divide the data to 85/15 train/test. Although all the input parameters, including the intercept, are highly statistically significant, the R2 value of 0.431 for the linear regression model, when applied to the unseen test data, is too low to be acceptable. Therefore, more complex techniques should be utilized.

REVIEW: Cost Effective Smart Parking System on Campus 

PARKING PROBLEMS EFFECT:
Leads to stress and anxiety.
Wastes time and gas.

Using a Raspberry Pi 4 model B to determine if the space in the lot is empty through accurate camera mode and formular.

angle of the camera be A, 
height of the camera be h,
radius of the circle which will be covered by the camera be r. T
hen, 
R =h ∙ tan (A/2)

The area to be covered by a camera, A1, can be obtained as 
follows: 
A1 =(h∙tan (A/2))^ 2= ∏ * h^2 * (tan) ^2 (A/2)

Let the area of the parking lot be P, and the number of cameras be N1. Then, 
N1 =  P / A1
 
The length of the side of a square (l) inside of the circle is 
√2r. Therefore, the area of the square inside the circle, A2, is: 
A2  =  l^2  =  (√2∙h∙tan (A/2) )^ 2  =  2∙h^2  ∙(tan)^2 (A/2)

The number of cameras, N2, to be installed to cover the area of the parking lot (P), is: 
N2 = P / A2
