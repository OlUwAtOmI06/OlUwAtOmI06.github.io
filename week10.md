Monday.
After training and testing our model using CNN we got an accuracy of 54.
I was really scared cause i thought  we had failed.

We revisted the presentation slide and practice but i was still shaking.

i Wrote down my Prenstation script


ood Morning everyone My name is Oluwatomi Adenekan, This is Dipesh Banajara and this is Khem Chand . Our Graduate mentor  and faculty mentor are Pelumi Abiodun and Dr Oludare Owolabi respectively. Our high school teacher is Mr Steven Hinnant. Our project is parkingsense.
These studies collectively aim to address the growing parking demand at Morgan by employing innovative methods and technologies to enhance parking management and efficiency. These studies collectively aim to address the growing parking demand at universities by employing innovative methods and technologies to enhance parking management and efficiency. Our overgoal was to build a parking model.
We used a traditional image processing techniques because Traditional image processing techniques are used for building parking detection systems for several reasons:
 
   - Cost-Effective: Traditional image processing algorithms are often simpler and less computationally intensive than advanced machine learning models. This can make them more cost-effective, especially for systems with limited hardware resources.
   - Faster Processing: Basic image processing techniques, such as thresholding, edge detection, and contour detection, can be executed quickly, which is crucial for real-time applications.
 
   - Hardware Limitations: Many parking detection systems are implemented on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi or embedded systems. Traditional techniques require fewer resources compared to complex machine learning models, making them suitable for such environments.
 
   - Transparency: Traditional image processing techniques are generally more interpretable. This means that the decision-making process of the system can be more easily understood and adjusted, which is useful for troubleshooting and system improvements.
 
 
   - Essential Pre-Processing: Many advanced methods, including machine learning models, rely on pre-processed data. Traditional image processing techniques are often used for pre-processing tasks like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and object segmentation, which are crucial for the performance of subsequent models.
 
   - Quick Response: For systems requiring immediate feedback, such as real-time parking space detection, traditional image processing techniques can provide the necessary speed and responsiveness.
 
 
IMPORTATNT OF THIS PROJECT
Among every single Research article read not one included an HBCU and if you decided to add  HBCU to the research keyword search it would bring up different research that has nothing to do with Parking.
Another reasons is that HBCU are growing rapidly like morgan for example. Since 2018, the public university saw its enrollment surge 27%, with 9,808 students attending the institution this past fall. The university has set its sights on reaching 10,000 students by 2030, said Khala Granville, Morgan State's director of undergraduate admission and recruitment
 
(While traditional methods provide a solid foundation for parking space detection, they may have limitations in more complex or dynamic environments. This presentation will discuss how these techniques can be integrated with advanced methods, such as machine learning, to enhance performance and address varied conditions.
Conclusion:
Traditional image processing techniques offer a viable and practical approach to parking space detection, particularly in environments where simplicity and resource constraints are paramount. By leveraging these methods, we can develop effective parking management solutions that are both cost-effective and efficient, paving the way for smarter urban mobility solutions.

TUESDAY.
We presented and Doctor Waters said something that i will forever hold dear which is that we should be afraid or ashamed of our result that is what a research is all about.

WEDSNESDAY.
We rewrote our paper using the given docs template.
