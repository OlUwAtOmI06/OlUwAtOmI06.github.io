Weekly Research Report: Week 2
Research Topic: Improving Parking Efficiency in University

Executive Summary

This week, we focused on understanding machine learning fundamentals to apply them to our project on improving parking efficiency. We reviewed relevant literature, gathered initial data, and began exploring suitable machine learning models. Key challenges included data cleaning and selecting appropriate features for the models.

Introduction

The research aims to enhance parking efficiency at the university by utilizing machine learning techniques. After outlining the project goals and reviewing the current parking situation last week, this week we delved into machine learning principles and their applications to our research.

Weekly Activities

    Tasks Completed:

Sessions with Doctor Anita Pandey:
   Public Session (Monday): Attended a seminar on the importance of writing for academic visibility.
   Private Session (Thursday): One-on-one meeting focused on personalized writing strategies and the importance of a clear research question.
Literature Review: Reviewed academic papers and articles on machine learning applications in parking systems and smart cities. Key papers included those Channamallu et al. (2023) on comparative analysis of parking occupancy prediction models using machine learning techniques.
Data Collection: Gathered initial parking data from parking apps like Spothero, focusing on unique features such as real-time availability and pricing.
Data Cleaning: Processed the collected data to handle missing values and inconsistencies using Python's Pandas library.
Machine Learning Introduction: Completed an introductory course on machine learning from Coursera, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
Feature Selection: Identified potential features for our machine learning models, such as time of day, day of the week, and special event schedules.

Findings
Key Patterns: Identified that the time of day and day of the week are strong indicators of parking occupancy. Special events significantly disrupt usual parking patterns, suggesting the need for dynamic models that can adapt to such variations. A comparative analysis by Channamallu et al. (2023) supports this, demonstrating that random forest models perform better in predicting parking occupancy due to their accuracy and classification performance, as indicated by lower MAE values and higher R² values compared to decision tree, SVR, and linear regression models.
Timing of Data Collection: Noted that summer is a bad time to conduct data tests due to holidays, which affect usual parking patterns.


Discussion
This week's focus on machine learning fundamentals provided a solid foundation for applying these techniques to our parking efficiency project. The initial data analysis highlighted key patterns in parking usage, guiding our feature selection for the models. Moving forward, we need to refine our feature set and begin training preliminary models.

Next Steps
Data Augmentation: Collect data from the school parking services.
Model Training: Begin training preliminary machine learning models using supervised learning techniques.

This week marked significant progress in our research by laying the groundwork for applying machine learning to improve parking efficiency. We addressed initial data challenges and began the process of research gathering. The insights gained will direct our efforts in the coming weeks as we develop our models.
