During the first week, I met with Dr. Oludare and my mentor to discuss the project 
that I will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Oludare will be looking for. 
Dr. Oludare also explained to me what, "ParkingSense", is alongside its importance and worth.
We discussed YOLO. A term i had never heard.

In my first week, I was introduced to python by Micheal Adeleke. I was also introduced to Machine
Learning with SCIKIT-LEARN. I was able to bond with my team mates during the team building activity
and we were asked to build a tall tower made of Spaghetti, Mushmellows and Tape.
