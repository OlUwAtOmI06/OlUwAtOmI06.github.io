During the first week, I met with Dr. Oludare and my mentor to discuss the project 
that I will be working on and gained an understanding of what Dr. Oludare will be looking for. 
Dr. Oludare also explained to me what, "ParkingSense", is alongside its importance and worth.
We discussed YOLO. A term i had never heard.

In my first week, I was introduced to python by Micheal Adeleke. I was also introduced to Machine
Learning with SCIKIT-LEARN. I was able to bond with my team mates during the team building activity
and we were asked to build a tall tower made of Spaghetti, Mushmellows and Tape.

Our Team  ALGORITHM invloves building a triangular based and a straight head. The problem with our Algorithm
was that the base was not strong enough. it invovled tape spaghetti's two by two and  they taping them to 
follow a triangular shape. 

The only problem was that the people who presented Pandas and Numpy were  ttalking too fast and were mostly
concerntrated on finishing their slide than people understanding.

I love the first day orientation when Dr Waters said that 'You don't have to think like a programmer but a
researcher'. All in all it was a fun experience.
